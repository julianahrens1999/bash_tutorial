The Bash Command Line
=====================

![*Tux, the Linux penguin*](tux.png)

This tutorial makes you familiar with **bash**, the Linux command line. You will learn to:

* navigate directories
* manipulate files
* execute programs

If you have no previous experience with Unix-like
systems or know a few commands but would like to know more, this tutorial is for you.

### Prerequisites

*This tutorial was prepared for Ubuntu Linux, but it works on MacOS,
Cygwin and the Git bash as well, given that Python 3 is installed on
your system.*

----

## Goal

In this tutorial, you will be looking for a word with 22 characters:

![](solution.png)

All characters are hidden in the exercises below.

## Preparations

* clone the repository or download the code as a ZIP file
* locate the  `exercises/` folder
* open a `bash` terminal

## 1. Directories and files


### 1.1. Navigating directories

The **first character** is hidden in a file somewhere in the *exercise1* directory tree. Look through subdirectories until you find one with the name `solution_1.1` and list its contents.

### 1.2. Show a hidden file

Some files are not visible immediately. The **second character**, is in the same directory as the first one, but in a hidden file.

### 1.3. Execute a program

Go back to the directory `exercise_1/directoryB/`. When listing its contents, you should see a **shell script file** `program.sh`. To find the **third character**, you need to execute the program.

### 1.4. Find out how big a file is

Go to the folder `exercise_1/directoryC/`. To find **the fourth character**, you need to find out how big the text file in the directory is.

To obtain the fourth character look up the file size in the [Table of
printable ASCII
characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters):

## 2. Edit text files

Please go back to the top directory of the tutorial material. Then, change to the directory `exercise_2`.

### 2.1. See what is in a text file

In the directory *exercise\_2/*, you will find a text file *solution\_2.1.txt*. The **fifth character** is inside that file.

### 2.2. Edit text files

To get **character number six**, you will need to create a text file in the `exercise_2` directory. On Ubuntu, you can do this using the editor `nano`.

**To exit nano, type Ctrl-X**

Create a text file with the characters you have found so far.

The **sixth character** is the one you need to press to save a file in
`nano`.

----

## 3. Copy and remove files

Please go to the directory exercise\_3.

### 3.1. Create a directory and copy a file to it.

To find **characters seven and eight**, you need to create a subdirectory named *solution* in `exercise_3/` and copy the files from the `part1/` and `part2/` folders into it. Then, look at the files in the soltion folder.

### 3.2. Removing files

In the `data` directory, all files with an `Y` need to be deleted. Use Wildcards to delete the files. To get **characters nine and ten**, look at the files that remain after deleting all that contain a `Y`.

----

## 4. Process text data

Please go to the directory exercise\_4.

### 4.1. comparing two files

There are two different versions of a quote, `ai.txt`, and `artificial_intelligence.txt`. The **11th character** of the solution is the single character in which the
two files differ. Do not do this manually but use a command.

### 4.2. Sorting a text file

The **12th character** of the solution is the first character of the last word in the file elephant.txt when all lines are sorted alphabetically.

### 4.3. Finding words in a text file

To find the **13th character**, search for the word **fire** in the file `datascience.txt` and take the **first** character of the output. Do not do this manually but use a command.

----

## 5. Unzip files

Please go to the directory exercise\_5.

### 5.1. unzipping archives

The **14th and 15th character** of the solution are in a multiply
wrapped archive in the exercise\_5 directory.

----

## 6. Command-line tools

Please go to the directory `exercise_6`.

### 6.1. Changing file access rights

To see **characters 16+17** of the solution, make the program `permissions.sh` executable. Then execute it.

### 6.2. How much disk space have I left?

To obtain the **18th character**, check out the version of the Unix utility program to find out empty disk space.

The solution is the last character of the programs first authors' first name.

### 6.3. Set an environment variable

To install some programs, it is necessary to set so-called environment
variables.

To obtain the **19th character**, you need to set the variable *GIVEME* to the value **SOLUTION**.

Find out the **characters position in the alphabet** by getting the number of bytes in the value of the GIVEME variable.

### 6.4. Check whether you have internet

The **20th character** is the `ping` option that sets the maximum number of requests sent. Check the documentation in the manpages.

### 6.5. Managing processes

Use the Linux equivalent of the Windows Task Manager to display currently running programs.

The **last two characters** of the solution are the first two characters
of the second word in the line containing the column labels.
